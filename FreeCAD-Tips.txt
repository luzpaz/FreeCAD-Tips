Did you know you can use Tools → Dependency graph... to view dependencies between objects in the active document as a graph? As opposed to the Model tree, objects are listed in reverse chronological order, with the first created object at the bottom. Dependency Graphs can be used to correct seemingly broken models whereby one forks their model by creating dependencys on the same object which they later unite on (Note: you must have Graphviz installed). See https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Dependency_Graph for further info.
